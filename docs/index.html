<h3 id="director-of-site-reliability-engineering-cyware">Director of
Site Reliability Engineering, Cyware</h3>
<p>2023 to Present, Charlotte, NC (remote)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hired to separate SRE function from DevOps, but remain very
hands-on.</li>
<li>Led team of 5 Senior Site Reliability Engineers, reporting to Senior
VP of Engineering.</li>
<li>Evaluated several observability platforms and settled on continuing
with Grafana stack due to highest ROI.</li>
<li>Wrote numerous custom API solutions in Python to ingest crtitical
metrics from Cyware core applications into Prometheus and automate
mundane tasks, like EC2 disk expansions.</li>
<li>Deployed ‘masterless Puppet’ GitOps-based state configuration for
legacy EC2 platform, to stabilize and prevent recurring issues due to
inconsistent configurations.</li>
<li>Wrote custom solution (Python + Go) to pull metrics for all alerts
to move to data driven based decision making.</li>
<li>Wrote logic and Grafana dashboard to track ‘all-customer’ and
‘per-customer’ uptime and SLA metrics.</li>
<li>Built-out follow-the-sun on-call rotation in Opsgenie, blameless
post mortem, and established first set of SLIs, which led to achievable
SLOs and SLAs.</li>
<li>In &lt; 1 year, decreased number of average monthly alerts from over
1,000 to less than 50, and brought uptime from 95% to 99.98% across all
customers.</li>
<li>Partnered with DevOps to champion “Next-Generation” Kubernetes based
GitOps platform, rolled out in January 2024.</li>
<li>Responsible for disaster recovery and cloud-related BCP architecture
and SOPs.</li>
<li>Championed and deployed hybrid-cloud for non-production workloads,
decreasing monthly AWS spend by over 50%.</li>
<li>Finally, championed a “document-all-the-things!” approach, to
prevent accumulation of tribal knowledge, prevent errors and
inconsistencies, and improve operational time to resolution.</li>

<li>Led the development and execution of the cloud strategy, resulting
in a 400% reduction in AWS costs while improving reliability from &lt;
90% to &gt; 99.99%, as measured by BetterStack.</li>
<li>With no defined DevOps function, combined DevOps &amp; SRE into one
team, greatly improving collaboration from developer workstation through
production deployment.</li>
<li>Re-architected AWS platform using AWS Fargate and MongoDB Cloud to
reduce costs and complexity, while allowing platform to scale rapidly to
meet MAU target.</li>
<li>Worked in partnership with Datadog Partner to quickly deploy full
RUM and observability stack, while transfering operational knowledge to
my team, saving both time and money versus the go-it-alone
approach.</li>
