## Experience

### Director of Site Reliability Engineering, Cyware

2023 to Present, Charlotte, NC (remote)

- Hired to separate SRE function from DevOps, but remain very hands-on.
- Led team of 5 Senior Site Reliability Engineers, reporting to Senior VP of Engineering.
- Evaluated several observability platforms and settled on continuing with Grafana stack due to highest ROI.
- Wrote numerous custom API solutions in Python to ingest crtitical metrics from Cyware core applications into Prometheus and automate mundane tasks, like EC2 disk expansions.
- Deployed 'masterless Puppet' GitOps-based state configuration for legacy EC2 platform, to stabilize and prevent recurring issues due to inconsistent configurations.
- Wrote custom solution (Python + Go) to pull metrics for all alerts to move to data driven based decision making.
- Wrote logic and Grafana dashboard to track 'all-customer' and 'per-customer' uptime and SLA metrics.
- Built-out follow-the-sun on-call rotation in Opsgenie, blameless post mortem, and established first set of SLIs, which led to achievable SLOs and SLAs.
- In < 1 year, decreased number of average monthly alerts from over 1,000 to less than 50, and brought uptime from 95% to 99.98% across all customers.
- Partnered with DevOps to champion "Next-Generation" Kubernetes based GitOps platform, rolled out in January 2024.
- Responsible for disaster recovery and cloud-related BCP architecture and SOPs.
- Championed and deployed hybrid-cloud for non-production workloads, decreasing monthly AWS spend by over 50%.
- Finally, championed a "document-all-the-things!" approach, to prevent accumulation of tribal knowledge, prevent errors and inconsistencies, and improve operational time to resolution.

**Technologies used:** Python, Bash, Terraform, AWS, Azure, Grafana, Loki, LogQL, Prometheus, PromQL, ArgoCD, Puppet, Kubernetes, Helm, Docker

- Led the development and execution of the cloud strategy, resulting in a 400% reduction in AWS costs while improving reliability from < 90% to > 99.99%, as measured by BetterStack.
- With no defined DevOps function, combined DevOps & SRE into one team, greatly improving collaboration from developer workstation through production deployment.
- Re-architected AWS platform using AWS Fargate and MongoDB Cloud to reduce costs and complexity, while allowing platform to scale rapidly to meet MAU target.
- Worked in partnership with Datadog Partner to quickly deploy full RUM and observability stack, while transfering operational knowledge to my team, saving both time and money versus the go-it-alone approach.
- Established SLIs, SLOs, and resultant SLAs.
